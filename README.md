# EpicU Student Samples
This is my public repo for EpicU students.  There will be challenge projets (my working model), homework and a lot of other stuff.

Great place to see how I did the solutions or just study me to get 'flow' down.


## Best Practices
### Branching - Naming

#### Short well-defined tokens ####
Choose short tokens so they do not add too much noise to every one of your branch names. I use these:

>**wip**   --  Works in progress; stuff I know won't be finished soon

>**feat**  --  Feature I'm adding or expanding

>**bug**   --  Bug fix or experiment

>**junk**  --  Throwaway branch created to experiment
